# Simpleauth-demo

This is an example Ember CLI application that uses [Ember Simple Auth](https://github.com/simplabs/ember-simple-auth) with a [Cookie Store](https://github.com/simplabs/ember-simple-auth/tree/master/packages/ember-simple-auth-cookie-store).

It authenticates successfully with a Rails back-end that uses Devise.

See the [instructions](https://github.com/simplabs/ember-simple-auth/tree/master/packages/ember-simple-auth-devise) on how to set up the server side.

See [`packages.json`](https://github.com/liquid/ember-simpleauth-devise-demo/blob/master/package.json) for a list of direct dependencies and their versions.
